//public class WeaponBase extends ItemBase {

    //public WeaponBase(){

    //}

    // Do I have to extend ItemBase further to something like "MaterialBase" to add more specific input parameters like rarity in the world, size/shape, color, etc.?
    // And furthermore, how would I add a new material entirely??? -> i.e. Crystal: harvest level 3, uses 2500, efficiency 9.0, damage 10.0, enchantability 10
