#MINECRAFT CIVILIZATION PROJECT

  We had a vision about having a minecraft game where the villagers are
more than just scenery with buildings you can just bum in. We thought it
would be cool if the villagers tried to become the masters of the randomly
generated world created for them...and fight the other villagers. So the
hope is that we have the villagers act a little Medieval.
