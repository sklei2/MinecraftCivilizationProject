Steps for the minecraft version control.

FOR RJ (or other clueless people)

I'm assuming that you already have minecraft installed (or at least have the jar).

1. get the forge-1.8-11.14.1.1334-installer.jar and -src.zip, both found
at http://files.minecraftforge.net/

2. run the forge-installer.jar and just keep hitting next. To run in the terminal just cd to whereever the installer.jar is and then type "java -jar *.jar" where the * should be whater the name of the jar is.

3. put the forge-src.zip into a folder on the desktop called "Minecraft".

4. Unzip the forge-src.zip in the "Minecraft" folder and it should leave a folder called "forge-1.8-11.14.1.1334-src" in the folder.

5. Use the terminal to go to "~/Desktop/Minecraft/forge-1.8-11.14.1.1334-src" Then type the following command "./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace --refresh-dependencies". Now I'm just going to assume this works. So if it doesn't you'll need to mess with JAVA_HOME or the path variable or something.

6. Then once 5 is done type "./gradlew eclipse" Again...assuming this works.

7. Open eclipse. Then make sure that the workspace you go to is "~/Desktop/Minecraft/forge-1.8-11.14.1.1334-src/eclipse" This will make sure that the workspace you use will have the minecraft forge files needed for modding.

8. BACK TO THE TERMINAL!!! Then cd into the directory "~/Desktop/Minecraft" (This folder should ONLY have the forge-1.8-11.14.1.1334-src in it.

9. Once there run the following commands:
    "git init"
    "git remote add origin ***" where *** is the HTTPS link from the repository found on github.com

10. Then to verify that it is the at the correct reposity type:
     "git remote -v"
    This should return the https link twice (one for fetch and one for push)

11. Know that the first time you need to push or to pull you need to type "git push -u origin master" or "git pull -u origin master", respectively. After doing this the first time it should be all setup and you won't need to type the "-u..." part. 

Now that should set it up. We're going to screw the eclipse git and use the Terminal. Just make sure that you are in the directory "~/Desktop/Minecraft" when you try do do any commits. Also, when adding make sure to specify the specific file pretty please??? Also I don't think we should add our .project file. Just in case.
